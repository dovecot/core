# Contributing to Dovecot

We welcome contributions to the Dovecot project. To help us maintain a
consistent and high‑quality codebase, please follow the guidelines below.

## How to Contribute

1. **Open a Pull Request**

   * All changes should be submitted as a pull request against the `dovecot/core` repository.
   * Clearly describe the problem your change solves and provide any relevant background.

2. **Follow the Coding Style**

   * All contributions should adhere to the Dovecot coding style:
     [https://doc.dovecot.org/latest/developers/coding_style.html](https://doc.dovecot.org/latest/developers/coding_style.html)
   * Submissions that do not follow the required style may be requested to change before review.

3. **Be Prepared for Review**

   * Maintainers may request adjustments or clarifications.
   * Tests or additional documentation may be required depending on the change.

4. **We will not participate in any kind of contribution contests**

## Acceptance of Contributions

While we appreciate all contributions, **the Dovecot team reserves the right to
accept or reject any pull request at its discretion**. This helps ensure quality,
security, maintainability, and alignment with project goals.

Even so, **all contributions are welcome**, and discussion on proposed changes
is encouraged.

Dovecot core repository is mirrored from our internal instance, so your pull
request will be processed and merged outside github.

Thank you for helping improve Dovecot!
