## Dovecot configuration file

# If you're in a hurry, see http://wiki.dovecot.org/QuickConfiguration

# "dovecot -n" command gives a clean output of the changed settings. Use it
# instead of copy&pasting this file when posting to the Dovecot mailing list.

# '#' character and everything after it is treated as comments. Extra spaces
# and tabs are ignored. If you want to use either of these explicitly, put the
# value inside quotes, eg.: key = "# char and trailing whitespace  "

# Default values are shown for each setting, it's not required to uncomment
# any of the lines. Exception to this are paths, they're just examples with
# the real defaults being based on configure options. The paths listed here
# are for configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
# --with-ssldir=/etc/ssl

# Base directory where to store runtime data.

# A space separated list of IP or host addresses where to listen in for
# connections. "*" listens in all IPv4 interfaces. "[::]" listens in all IPv6
# interfaces, but may also listen in all IPv4 interfaces depending on the
# operating system. Use "*, [::]" for listening both IPv4 and IPv6.
#
# If you want to specify ports for each service, you will need to configure
# these settings inside the protocol imap/pop3 { ... } section, so you can
# specify different ports for IMAP/POP3. For example:
#   protocol imap {
#     listen = *:10143
#     ssl_listen = *:10943
#     ..
#   }
#   protocol pop3 {
#     listen = *:10100
#     ..
#   }
#listen = *

# Disable LOGIN command and all other plaintext authentications unless
# SSL/TLS is used (LOGINDISABLED capability). Note that if the remote IP
# matches the local IP (ie. you're connecting from the same computer), the
# connection is considered secure and plaintext authentication is allowed.
#disable_plaintext_auth = yes

# Should all IMAP and POP3 processes be killed when Dovecot master process
# shuts down. Setting this to "no" means that Dovecot can be upgraded without
# forcing existing client connections to close (although that could also be
# a problem if the upgrade is eg. because of a security fix). This however
# means that after master process has died, the client processes can't write
# to log files anymore.

## Login processes

#login_process_size = 64

# Should each login be processed in it's own process (yes), or should one

# of them are used at the time, we double their amount until the limit set by
# this setting is reached.
#login_max_processes_count = 128

## Mailbox locations and namespaces
##

# Location for users' mailboxes. This is the same as the old default_mail_env
# setting. The default is empty, which means that Dovecot tries to find the
# mailboxes automatically. This won't work if the user doesn't have any mail
# yet, so you should explicitly tell Dovecot the full location.
#
# If you're using mbox, giving a path to the INBOX file (eg. /var/mail/%u)
# isn't enough. You'll also need to tell Dovecot where the other mailboxes are
# kept. This is called the "root mail directory", and it must be the first
# path given in the mail_location setting.
#
# There are a few special variables you can use, eg.:
#
#   %u - username
#   %n - user part in user@domain, same as %u if there's no domain
#   %d - domain part in user@domain, empty if there's no domain
#   %h - home directory
#
# See doc/wiki/Variables.txt for full list. Some examples:
#
#   mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir
#   mail_location = mbox:~/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u
#   mail_location = mbox:/var/mail/%d/%1n/%n:INDEX=/var/indexes/%d/%1n/%n
#
# <doc/wiki/MailLocation.txt>
#
#mail_location = 

# If you need to set multiple mailbox locations or want to change default
# namespace settings, you can do it by defining namespace sections.
# NOTE: Namespaces currently work ONLY with IMAP! POP3 and LDA currently ignore
# namespaces completely, they use only the mail_location setting.
#
# You can have private, shared and public namespaces. The only difference
# between them is how Dovecot announces them to client via NAMESPACE
# extension. Shared namespaces are meant for user-owned mailboxes which are
# shared to other users, while public namespaces are for more globally
# accessible mailboxes.
#
# REMEMBER: If you add any namespaces, the default namespace must be added
# explicitly, ie. mail_location does nothing unless you have a namespace
# without a location setting. Default namespace is simply done by having a
# namespace with empty prefix.
#namespace private {
   # Hierarchy separator to use. You should use the same separator for all
   # namespaces or some clients get confused. '/' is usually a good one.
   # The default however depends on the underlying mail storage format.
   #separator = 

   # Prefix required to access this namespace. This needs to be different for
   # all namespaces. For example "Public/".
   #prefix =

   #location =

   # There can be only one INBOX, and this setting defines which namespace
   # has it.
   #inbox = no

   # If namespace is hidden, it's not advertised to clients via NAMESPACE
   # extension. You'll most likely also want to set list=no. This is mostly
   # useful when converting from another server with different namespaces which
   # you want to deprecate but still keep working. For example you can create
   # hidden namespaces with prefixes "~/mail/", "~%u/mail/" and "mail/".
   #hidden = yes

   # Show the mailboxes under this namespace with LIST command. This makes the
   # namespace visible for clients that don't support NAMESPACE extension.

#mail_privileged_group =

# Grant access to these supplementary groups for mail processes. Typically
# these are used to set up access to shared mailboxes. Note that it may be
# dangerous to set these if users can create symlinks (e.g. if "mail" group is
# set here, ln -s /var/mail ~/mail/var could allow a user to delete others'
# mailboxes, or ln -s /secret/shared/box ~/mail/mybox would allow reading it).
#mail_access_groups =

#mail_drop_priv_before_exec = no

# (eg. shared mailboxes or if same uid is used for multiple accounts).
#verbose_proctitle = no

# Valid UID range for users, defaults to 500 and above. This is mostly

# (eg. /home/./user chroots into /home). Note that usually there is no real
# need to do chrooting, Dovecot doesn't allow users to access files outside

##
## Mailbox handling optimizations
##

# The minimum number of mails in a mailbox before updates are done to cache
# file. This allows optimizing Dovecot's behavior to do less disk writes at
# the cost of more disk reads.
#mail_cache_min_mail_count = 0

# When IDLE command is running, mailbox is checked once in a while to see if
# there are any new mails or other changes. This setting defines the minimum
# time in seconds to wait between those checks. Dovecot can also use dnotify,
# inotify and kqueue to find out immediately when changes occur.
#mailbox_idle_check_interval = 30

# Save mails with CR+LF instead of plain LF. This makes sending those mails
# take less CPU, especially with sendfile() syscall with Linux and FreeBSD.
# But it also creates a bit more disk I/O which may just make it slower.
# Also note that if other software reads the mboxes/maildirs, they may handle
# the extra CRs wrong and cause problems.
#mail_save_crlf = no

##
## Maildir-specific settings
##

# By default LIST command returns all entries in maildir beginning with a dot.
# Enabling this option makes Dovecot return only entries which are directories.
# This is done by stat()ing each entry, so it causes more disk I/O.
# (For systems setting struct dirent->d_type, this check is free and it's
# done always regardless of this setting)
#maildir_stat_dirs = no

# When copying a message, do it with hard links whenever possible. This makes
# the performance much better, and it's unlikely to have any side effects.
#maildir_copy_with_hardlinks = yes

# When copying a message, try to preserve the base filename. Only if the
# destination mailbox already contains the same name (ie. the mail is being
# copied there twice), a new name is given. The destination filename check is
# done only by looking at dovecot-uidlist file, so if something outside
# Dovecot does similar filename preserving copies, you may run into problems.
# NOTE: This setting requires maildir_copy_with_hardlinks = yes to work.
#maildir_copy_preserve_filename = no

##
## mbox-specific settings
##

# Which locking methods to use for locking mbox. There are four available:
#  dotlock: Create <mailbox>.lock file. This is the oldest and most NFS-safe
#           solution. If you want to use /var/mail/ like directory, the users
#           will need write access to that directory.
#  dotlock_try: Same as dotlock, but if it fails because of permissions or
#               because there isn't enough disk space, just skip it.
#  fcntl  : Use this if possible. Works with NFS too if lockd is used.
#  flock  : May not exist in all systems. Doesn't work with NFS.
#  lockf  : May not exist in all systems. Doesn't work with NFS.
#
# You can use multiple locking methods; if you do the order they're declared
# in is important to avoid deadlocks if other MTAs/MUAs are using multiple
# locking methods as well. Some operating systems don't allow using some of
# them simultaneously.

#mbox_dotlock_change_timeout = 120

# When mbox changes unexpectedly we have to fully read it to find out what
# changed. If the mbox is large this can take a long time. Since the change
# is usually just a newly appended mail, it'd be faster to simply read the
# new mails. If this setting is enabled, Dovecot does this but still safely
# fallbacks to re-reading the whole mbox file whenever something in mbox isn't
# how it's expected to be. The only real downside to this setting is that if
# some other MUA changes message flags, Dovecot doesn't notice it immediately.
# Note that a full sync is done with SELECT, EXAMINE, EXPUNGE and CHECK 
# commands.
#mbox_dirty_syncs = yes

# Like mbox_dirty_syncs, but don't do full syncs even with SELECT, EXAMINE,
# EXPUNGE or CHECK commands. If this is set, mbox_dirty_syncs is ignored.
#mbox_very_dirty_syncs = no

# Delay writing mbox headers until doing a full write sync (EXPUNGE and CHECK
# commands and when closing the mailbox). This is especially useful for POP3
# where clients often delete all mails. The downside is that our changes
# aren't immediately visible to other MUAs.

  # <doc/wiki/PasswordDatabase.txt>
  #
  # By adding master=yes setting inside a passdb you make the passdb a list
  # of "master users", who can log in as anyone else. Unless you're using PAM,
  # you probably still want the destination user to be looked up from passdb
  # that it really exists. This can be done by adding pass=yes setting to the
  # master passdb. <doc/wiki/Authentication.MasterUsers.txt>

  # Users can be temporarily disabled by adding a passdb with deny=yes.
  # If the user is found from that database, authentication will fail.
  # The deny passdb should always be specified before others, so it gets
  # checked first. Here's an example:

    # File contains a list of usernames, one per line

  # PAM authentication. Preferred nowadays by most systems. 
  # Note that PAM can only be used to verify if user's password is correct,
  # so it can't be used as userdb. If you don't want to use a separate user
  # database (passwd usually), you can use static userdb.

    # need that. They aren't ever deleted though, so this isn't enabled by

    #
    # cache_key can be used to enable authentication caching for PAM
    # (auth_cache_size also needs to be set). It isn't enabled by default
    # because PAM modules can do all kinds of checks besides checking password,
    # such as checking IP address. Dovecot can't know about these checks
    # without some help. cache_key is simply a list of variables (see
    # doc/wiki/Variables.txt) which must match for the cached data to be used.
    # Here are some examples:
    #   %u - Username must match. Probably sufficient for most uses.
    #   %u%r - Username and remote IP address must match.
    #   %u%s - Username and service (ie. IMAP, POP3) must match.
    # 
    # The service name can contain variables, for example %Ls expands to
    # pop3 or imap.

## Plugin settings

plugin {
  # Here you can give some extra environment variables to mail processes.
  # This is mostly meant for passing parameters to plugins. %variable
  # expansion is done for all values.

  # Quota plugin. Multiple backends are supported:
  #   dirsize: Find and sum all the files found from mail directory.
  #            Extremely SLOW with Maildir. It'll eat your CPU and disk I/O.
  #   dict: Keep quota stored in dictionary (eg. SQL)
  #   maildir: Maildir++ quota
  #   fs: Read-only support for filesystem quota
  #
  # Quota limits are set using "quota_rule" parameters, either in here or in
  # userdb. It's also possible to give mailbox-specific limits, for example:
  #   quota_rule = *:storage=1048576
  #   quota_rule2 = Trash:storage=102400
  # User has now 1GB quota, but when saving to Trash mailbox the user gets
  # additional 100MB.
  #
  # Multiple quota roots are also possible, for example:
  #   quota = dict:user::proxy::quota
  #   quota2 = dict:domain:%d:proxy::quota_domain
  #   quota_rule = *:storage=102400
  #   quota2_rule = *:storage=1048576
  # Gives each user their own 100MB quota and one shared 1GB quota within
  # the domain.
  #
  # You can execute a given command when user exceeds a specified quota limit.
  # Each quota root has separate limits. Only the command for the first
  # exceeded limit is excecuted, so put the highest limit first.
  # Note that % needs to be escaped as %%, otherwise "% " expands to empty.
  #   quota_warning = storage=95%% /usr/local/bin/quota-warning.sh 95
  #   quota_warning2 = storage=80%% /usr/local/bin/quota-warning.sh 80
  #quota = maildir

  # ACL plugin. vfile backend reads ACLs from "dovecot-acl" file from maildir
  # directory. You can also optionally give a global ACL directory path where
  # ACLs are applied to all users' mailboxes. The global ACL directory contains
  # one file for each mailbox, eg. INBOX or sub.mailbox. cache_secs parameter
  # specifies how many seconds to wait between stat()ing dovecot-acl file
  # to see if it changed.

  # Trash plugin. When saving a message would make user go over quota, this
  # plugin automatically deletes the oldest mails from configured mailboxes
  # until the message can be saved within quota limits. The configuration file
  # is a text file where each line is in format: <priority> <mailbox name>
  # Mails are first deleted in lowest -> highest priority number order
  #trash = /etc/dovecot-trash.conf

  # Expire plugin. Mails are expunged from mailboxes after being there the
  # configurable time. The first expiration date for each mailbox is stored in
  # a dictionary so it can be quickly determined which mailboxes contain
  # expired mails. The actual expunging is done in a nightly cronjob, which
  # you must set up:
  #   dovecot --exec-mail ext /usr/libexec/dovecot/expire-tool
  #expire = Trash 7 Spam 30
  #expire_dict = db:/var/lib/dovecot/expire.db

  # Lazy expunge plugin. Currently works only with maildirs. When a user
  # expunges mails, the mails are moved to a mailbox in another namespace
  # (1st). When a mailbox is deleted, the mailbox is moved to another namespace
  # (2nd) as well. Also if the deleted mailbox had any expunged messages,
  # they're moved to a 3rd namespace. The mails won't be counted in quota,
  # and they're not deleted automatically (use a cronjob or something).
